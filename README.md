# Followers-checking
Don't you just wonder why your Instagram followers number keeps on dropping? Who is unfollowing you? Why are they doing that? While I can't answer the last question for you, I can answer the second question.

This is a simple python program that uses selenium and Chrome Driver to check who is not following you back on Instagram.

## Technologies:
Things needed for this program:
* Python 3.6 or later
* Selenium 
* Chrome Driver

## Setup:
1. Install selenium using terminal 
```
pip install selenium
```
2. Download Chrome driver from https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=90.0.4430.24/ 

## To run the code:
1. Pull this code
```
git pull
```
2. Change the PATH variable (line 6) to your own chrome driver's path
3. Run the code (make sure to not close the chrome window until the result is printed in the terminal)!

## Notes:
This program only works when the chrome driver opens this version of Instagram. If this version is not what you see the first time running the code, 
re-run the code again.
